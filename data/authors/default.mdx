## Hi, I’m Leandro Simões

I’ve been working in software for over a decade, building web and mobile applications, leading teams, and helping companies turn ideas into real products.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from **UFJF**, where I specialized in **software engineering and recommendation systems**. During that time, I contributed to projects such as a recommender system for the Rio 2016 Olympics, funded by Capes, and published papers at both national and international conferences.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked on projects for clients including **DPSP, B2W, Vtex, ShopFácil, Yamaha, Record**, and others. I co-founded companies, joined leadership teams, and became a partner in a business later acquired by one of the largest payment companies in Latin America.

Currently, I’m working for a New York–based company, **TheGuarantors**.

## How I work

- **Problem-solving first:** I don’t believe in technology for its own sake — I believe in using it to solve real business problems.
- **Agility as adaptability:** For me, agility isn’t just about speed; it’s about responding effectively to change.
- **Knowledge sharing:** I prioritize mentoring teams, establishing practices like automated testing and observability, and ensuring that client teams grow stronger along the way.
